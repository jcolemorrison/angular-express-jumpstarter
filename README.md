### Express Angular Jumpstarter

This repository goes hand in hand with the updated tutorial found at:

[Building an Angular and Express App Part 1](http://start.jcolemorrison.com/building-an-angular-and-express-app-part-1/)

In order to use:

a) Run `grunt serve` in the `client` directory to up the clientside Angular server

b) Run `grutn test` in the `client` directory to run the Karma test server

c) Run `npm run dev` in the `server` directory to startup the Express API

d) Run `grunt build` in the `client` directory to build down the Angular app into the `server`'s `dist` directory

e) Run `npm start` in the `server` directory after a `grunt build` to have the entire app brought together under the `server`.
